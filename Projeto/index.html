Gran Turismo was developed by Polys Entertainment and published by Sony Computer Entertainment in 1997 for the PlayStation video game console. The game's development group was established as Polyphony Digital in 1998.<br></p>

		<p>After five years of development time, it was well-received publicly and critically, shipping a total of 10.85 million copies worldwide as of March 2013 (making it the best-selling PlayStation game), and scoring an average of 95% in GameRankings' aggregate, making it the highest rated racing video game of all-time. The game has started a series, and has spawned over 10 spin-offs and sequels.
		Gran Turismo is a racing game. The player must maneuver a car to compete against artificiallyintelligent drivers on various race tracks. The game uses two different modes: Arcade Mode and Simulation Mode (Gran Turismo Mode in PAL and Japanese versions). In the arcade mode, the player can freely choose the courses and vehicles they wish to use. Winning races unlocks additional cars and courses.

		<p><div align="justify">However, simulation mode requires the player to earn different levels of driver's licenses in order to qualify for events, and earn credits (money), trophies and prize cars by winning race championships. Winning one particular championship also unlocks a video and a few additional demonstration tracks. Credits can be used to purchase additional vehicles, and for parts and tuning.
		Gran Turismo features 140 cars and 11 race tracks (as well as their reversed versions). Two Honda NSX cars from 1992 were included in the Japanese version, but were removed from the North American and European versions. There is also a 1967 Chevrolet Corvette and a 1998 Mazda Roadster exclusive to the Arcade mode.</div><br>

		<table width="700" height="200"><tr><td><div align="justify">All four games in the main series have been widely acclaimed by critics and video game publications for raising the standards of single-player video games, particularly with the series' second installment, Among Thieves, which is considered one of the greatest video games of all time. Reviewers have praised the games for their high production values, quality in storytelling, character design and animation, voice acting, realistic graphics, technical innovation, music score, gameplay mechanics, and delivering an enjoyably cinematic gaming experience to players. Critics have likened the series to Hollywood-produced action adventure films, particularly with the Indiana Jones films. Before the release of Uncharted 4, the series had sold over 28 million units, with the fourth installment becoming the highest-selling in the series with over 8.7 million copies sold. The critical and commercial success of the Uncharted games have been pivotal to the success of PlayStation during the seventh and eighth generation of video game consoles, and has helped elevate Naughty Dog's reputation to a highly respected video game developer in the industry.</div></tr></td></table><br>

In the game's online multiplayer mode, up to eight players engage in cooperative and competitive gameplay.

		<p>Development of The Last of Us began in 2009, soon after the release of Naughty Dog's previous game, Uncharted 2: Among Thieves. The relationship between Joel and Ellie became the central focus of the game, with all other elements developed around it. Actors Troy Baker and Ashley Johnson portrayed Joel and Ellie respectively through voice and motion capture, and assisted creative director Neil Druckmann with the development of the characters and story. The original score was composed and performed by Gustavo Santaolalla.

Oddworld: Abe's Oddysee, is a 2014 cinematic platform video game developed by Just Add Water and published by Oddworld Inhabitants as a "ground-up remake" of Oddworld: Abe's Oddysee. The game was released in North America on 22 July 2014 and in Europe on 23 July 2014 for the PlayStation 4. The title was also released for Linux, Microsoft Windows, OS X, Xbox One, PlayStation 3, PlayStation Vita and Wii U. It is set to be released for iOS.

		<p>In 2016, series creator Lorne Lanning announced at the Game Developers Conference that a follow up to Oddworld: New 'n' Tasty, titled Oddworld: Soulstorm, is in development.

		<p>In Oddworld: New 'n' Tasty, the player controls a Mudokon named Abe. Similar to the original, the gameplay is a sidescrolling platformer with an emphasis on puzzle solving, with New 'n' Tasty reimagined in a 2.5D graphical style.

		<p>Abe has the ability to talk to and direct other Mudokons with an enhanced GameSpeak feature and the characters will have more dialogue and responses when compared to the original game. The player's goal is to save all 299 Mudokon slaves (about three times as many as the original game) at RuptureFarms which can be done by taking them to bird portals; several Mudokons are hidden in secret areas which often involve complex situations. As with the original, the game has two endings depending on the number of Mudokons rescued by the game's finale; rescuing more than 150 is required for the Good Ending, fewer than that results in the Bad Ending instead.

		<p>Unlike the original game, there is a difficulty setting that changes gameplay elements such as Abe's health and enemy reaction times according to the difficulty level selected; "Hard", for instance, adjusts the game to a difficulty replicating the original game.</div></tr></td></table><br>

		<table width="700" height="200"><tr><td><div align="justify">Mortal Kombat X is a fighting video game developed by NetherRealm Studios and published by Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment. Running on the Unreal Engine 3, it is the tenth main installment in the Mortal Kombat video game series and a sequel to the 2011 game Mortal Kombat. It was released on April 14, 2015 for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One. NetherRealm studio's mobile team developed a version for iOS and Android devices. A version for Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 was in development but was eventually cancelled because NetherRealm could not get the seventh generation of consoles versions to the expected level of quality. High Voltage Studios developed the PC version of the game, with Polish studio QLoc taking over the work on it shortly after the release of Kombat Pack 1.

		<p>Like previous Mortal Kombat games, Mortal Kombat X's gameplay consists of two players, or one player and the CPU, fighting against each other with their selected character, using a large, varied array of character specific attacks. The game contains several modes, such as a story mode, which takes place twenty years after the previous Mortal Kombat game, several 'Tower' modes, which feature dynamically changing challenges, numerous online modes, and the 'Krypt', a mode played in a first-person perspective where players explore the areas unlocking a variety of in-game items.

		<div align="justify">The console versions of Mortal Kombat X received mostly positive reviews from critics upon release. Most praise was directed at the game's controls, overall gameplay, graphics, story, and characters, with some reviewers calling it the best game in the Mortal Kombat series. However, the PC version of the game was met with mixed reception, with reviewers blaming numerous technical issues (including frequent crashes and slow netcode) for severely hindering the experience. Selling more than 5 million copies, the game was the fastest-selling game in the franchise and the ninth best-selling game in 2015.

		<p>An upgraded version of Mortal Kombat X, titled Mortal Kombat XL, was released on March 1, 2016 for PlayStation 4 and Xbox One, including all downloadable content characters from the two released Kombat Packs, almost all bonus alternate costumes available at the time of release, improved gameplay, and improved netcode.
